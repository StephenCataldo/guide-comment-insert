Guide to Issues

Phase 1: Expert Guides

When you read an article, this chrome extension checks a list of keywords
of "issues" or topics connected to URLs from a "guide," and makes them
accessible. It is intended for commenting: providing cut-and-paste
quick replies to articles. The initial client is CogntivePolitics.org
and perhaps a facebook group Social Media Approaches for Respect and
Tolerance.

Phase 1B: Facebook and Twitter.

The main use-case is for commenting on facebook and twitter (as well
as news articles and blogs). Phase 1B is more tight integration with these
particular sites, integrating with posts or tweets instead of entire
pages.

Phase 2: DIY

This may one day become (or be integrated with) a bookmark tool,
so that when you come across an article you find convincing,
or a well-footnoted source that backs up your opinions on a topic,
 you can connect it to a keyword or hashtag and have it available
when commenting on that topic.
